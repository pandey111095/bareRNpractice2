This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# SQL Migrations (SQLite)
To add new script follow below steps:
## Using Shell
  1. Execute the following shell commands to create a migration script:
  ```shell
  chmod +x scripts/create-migration.sh && ./scripts/create-migration.sh
  ```
  2. This creates a .sql file following the naming convention, update the "update_this_title" part with the purpose of the migration and follow the instruction within that file.
      **(timestamp_purpose.sql ex:- 1758873906_create_versions_table.sql)**
  3. Add an entry to array migrations inside **src/db/migrations/index.ts** file like in following example, increasing the version number by 1 each time you add a new migration. Keep in mind that multiple scripts can be added to a single migration as long as they are separated by comma ('x','y','z'):
  ```typescript
    {
      version: 1,
      scriptFiles: ['1758873906_create_versions_table.sql'],
    }
  ```
  4. Build the application. In build process there is a script/task added to copy these sql files to the correspondent location inside bundled project of IOS and Android, so that our runMigration() will pick up scripts and execute.

## Manual
  1. Add your new script at below mentioned place:
      src/
        ├── db/
        │   ├── migrations/
  2. Naming convention should be like below:
      **(timestamp_purpose.sql ex:- 1758873906_create_versions_table.sql)**
  3. Execute steps 3 and 4 in Using Shell.
